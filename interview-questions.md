# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a language that allows for writing HTML code in javascript. a syntax difference between the two is that you need to use {} to indicate that you are writing javascript opposed to <></> for HTML

Researched answer: (the source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-differences-between-jsx-and-html/)

(source Language): JSX (JavaScript + XML) is an extension of JavaScript that permits you to write down HTML directly within JavaScript. which features a few benefits of creating your code more readable and exercising the complete power of JavaScript within HTML. JSX is in some ways almost like HTML, however, it does accompany certain conspicuous differences which we’ll cover within the next section. Since JSX isn’t a legitimate JS code, it must be compiled into JS with a tool like Babel or similar.

(My Interpretation)
JSX is an extension of javascript(I know the source said that) that filled a need to brige javascript and HTML for better functionality when programing. And like many things where there a benefits there are also shortcomings in the way of having to only return a single parent element. 

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is Yet Another Resource Negotiator. the files that are modified when runnin yarn are the node module files to add dependencies for related files and the yarn lock file that is created.

(The Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn_(package_manager))

(language from the source: Yarn is one of the main JavaScript package managers,developed in 2016 by Meta (formerly Facebook) for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment. An alternative to the npm package manager, Yarn was created as a collaboration of Facebook, Exponent (now Expo.dev), Google, and Tilde (the company behind Ember.js) to solve consistency, security, and performance problems with large codebases.)

(My Interpretation: Yarn as it's name states is Yet Another Resource negotiator. It is a package manager that will find, download and install files that you need for certain task. Looking into what yarn is ultimatily wasnt as frutifull in helping me understand as looking into what a package manager is. Because that is ultimatly what yarn is.)

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A react component is part if an overall react build. Best prectices seems to be to separate your compnentents for their specific purpose to prevent corrumption of the overall build.

Researched answer: 
(the source: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_components.asp#:~:text=Components%20are%20independent%20and%20reusable,will%20concentrate%20on%20Function%20components.)(secondary source: Manager XD Development Team at Illumina)

(language from the source: Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.)

(My interpretation: Components are are part of the build that are segrigated to make the code more D.R.Y and are resubale and make the code easier to read)

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are like a save point in a video game. At the start of the game the you spawn at the start of the level every time(current state). Till you hit a save point which changes your spawn point (setting a new state) for where you will "start the level" each time after that. Props are like the Portal Gun. They are arguments that are called between react components.

Researched answer:
(the source:https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp )

(language from the source: Props are arguments passed into React components.
The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.)

(My Interpretation: Props allow you to store properties in a diffent component and call them to the main file build when needed. keepying your code D.R.Y
States update you rendering based on a specific condition being met.)

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: the DOM is the Document Object Model. It is the visual representation of the code structure.

Researched answer: 
(the source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

(language from the source: 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.)

(My interpetation: The DOM is what you can use to change the overall structure of a page. ie: rearranging imges and text where they physically land on the page.)

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer:

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: is organizing programing around object rather than around functions or logics. Making it more user friendly and human interactive.

2. Ruby:is an object oreniented coding language

3. Implicit return: a return is built in so there is no need for a return statement

4. Ruby blocks: code functions that get passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes: similar to an array but indexing is not done by interger indexing.
